### A new method to bypass school restrictions by using unknown ways to embed a site

## How does this work and is this any good?

Well theoretically yes but also no, Some filter checkers like goguardian and linewize dont block iframes so these will probably work just fine but if any filter works by blocking any url in the page then this wont work UNLESS they update they stuff

## What site would you reccomend

I would reccomend not using this as an actual proxy but actually just go to a ubg site like frogie's arcade, doge unblocker and others. Also for the games i would use more lightweight ones like Run3 and not strong ones like eagler craft. Also if the links appears blocked change the method to another one.

## How did you have this idea

It first came to mind when i saw skidded proxies by astro and buypass and had the idea to make a """"""""proxy""""""" (Better to say embedder) that works like buypass ( with different methods to embed) but in a singular html file.

## Anything else to say?

This will not work on network based blocking unless you use a proxy with it (which is useless). Also if you have any problems at all check what the embed method you are using does (example: "<portal> tag what does it do html")
